Here is described how evaluation works and how you have to submit your solutions.

Every task today has it's own folder. There are 3 main tasks: Kinematics (direct and inverse), Model Identification and Crane Driving. 

Every folder has at least one read-only folder and one editable folder. In read-only folder we give you references and files you can see but cannot edit. You submit your solutions in editable folders as descrabed in "readme" files in every task.

Evaluation is automatic. When there is something in task's editable folder, evaluator will try to evaluate your solution. After evaluation is done, there will be created one file named result.txt which will give you info about how evaluation went. We tryed to be as specific about errors as possible, but if you have any other questions, ask your mentors.

IMPORTANT: evaluation will not be performed if you have in your task folder anything not mentioned in task's "readme" file. When you want evaluation to start, delete result.txt file from task's editable folder.

In task's read-only folder you will have a copy of last evaluation result.txt which will be graded at the end. Also, in read-only folder there will be "*.lock" file while your solution is beeing processed.
